# Human Skin Shader

A Unity project demonstrating a human skin shader, that I created using ShaderLab and HLSL. 
Conecpts used include the Blinn-Phong reflection model, normal mapping and translucency.
All the shader code can be found in the "Human Skin.shader" file under "\CGP-Mini-Project\Human-Skin-SHADER\Assets\Bj√∏rn\Shaders".
Requires Unity version 2021.3.9f1 to run.
