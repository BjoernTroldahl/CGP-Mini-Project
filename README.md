# Human Skin Shader

A human skin shader, that I created in Unity 2021.3.9f1 using HLSL. 
Concepts used include the Blinn-Phong reflection model, normal mapping and translucency.

The project was done in collaboration with Frederik Hald Stappert - he found the research papers and mathematical formulas that we needed and I programmed and implemented the shader.
